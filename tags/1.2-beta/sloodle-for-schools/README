SLOODLE for Schools Readme
--------------------------
This is a modified version of SLOODLE 1.1, for use with the SLOODLE for Schools system offered by Second Places. It relies on custom modifications in OpenSim, and is therefore not compatible with Second Life, or the main version of OpenSim.


What has been changed?
----------------------
The most important change is to the authentication system. Authentication is built-in to the OpenSim server, meaning individual tools do not need a password.
This allows the system to implicitly trust the HTTP headers specifying the owner of an object sending a request.

The need for avatar registration is also assumed to have been removed, because an outside system should provide authentication data.
