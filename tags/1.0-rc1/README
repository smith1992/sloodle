============
INSTALLATION
============

You can usually upgrade old versions simply by removing the existing
SLOODLE folder(s) from your installation, and replacing them with the
new ones.

There are four parts which you can install. The first is required in
order to use SLOODLE, but the other two are optional, and simply
provide some additional functionality.

-----------------
Module (required)
-----------------
1. Navigate to your Moodle's "mod" folder
2. If a "sloodle" folder exists there already, then delete it
3. Add the "sloodle" folder from this download


----------------
Block (optional)
----------------
1. Navigate to your Moodle's "blocks" folder
2. If a "sloodle_menu" fodler exists there already, then delete it
3. Add the "sloodle_menu" folder from this download


-------------------------------------------
Sloodle Object Assignment plugin (optional)
-------------------------------------------
(Enables use of the PrimDrop object)

1. Navigate to your Moodle's "mod/assignment/type" folder
2. If a "sloodleobject" folder exists there already, then delete it
3. Add the "sloodleobject" folder from this download

You will also need to alter your primary language pack.
E.g. if your primary language is English, then the <langcode> is "en_utf8".

1. Navigate to your Moodle's "lang/<langcode>" folder
2. Open the "assignment.php" file
3. Scroll to the bottom and add this line immediately before the last "?>":
    $string['typesloodleobject'] = 'Sloodle Object';

You can change the 'Sloodle Object' text to suit your needs.
You can repeat the process for other languages if necessary.


----------------
SLOODLE FreeMail
----------------
This is a special modification of a standard Moodle module, that allows
you to write Moodle blogs by sending an email. In this case, it lets you
send a 'postcard' snapshot from Second Life, and have the snapshot added
to your blog entry.

1. Navigate to your Moodle's "mod" folder
2. If a "freemail" folder exists there already, then delete it
3. Add the "freemail" folder from this download

You will need to setup a dedicated email account, and put the POP or IMAP
settings into the module configuration. (You can use GMail accounts too.)

To send a postcard from SL to your Moodle blog, email the postcard to the
address you setup. In the subject line, put the following:

b:username:password

(Replace "username" and "password" with your MOODLE username and password)
