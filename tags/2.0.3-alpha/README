1. WHAT IS SLOODLE?
===============================================================================
SLOODLE is an Open Source project which integrates the multi-user virtual environment of Second Life® with the Moodle® learning-management system funded by the Eduserve Foundation in the UK (http://www.eduserv.org.uk/)

SLOODLE provides a range of tools for supporting learning and teaching to the immersive virtual world; tools which are integrated with a tried and tested leading web-based learning management system. 
Sloodle is a platform to connect a Moodle Learning management website with the Virtual world of Second Life.

Sloodle consists of two parts: A zip file which gets unzipped and installed on your MOODLE Learning Management Website, and 
a suite of tools which can be rezzed (brought out of your inventory) into Second Life.

SLOODLE is free for use under the GNU GPL license - http://www.gnu.org/licenses/ and is funded and supported by Eduserv – http://www.eduserv.ac.uk/ with network services provided by San Jose State University's School of Library and Information Science - http://slisweb.sjsu.edu.

Dr. Daniel Livingstone, University of the West of Scotland, UK is co-founder and Eduserv principle investigator. Jeremy Kemp with SJSU is co-founder.

===============================================================================
2. NEW AND SPECIAL FEATURES IN THIS RELEASE
===============================================================================
Sloodle 1.0 has a great list of new features for educators in Second Life.
Sloodle 1.0
New Features

** Presenter
*    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNuf5aOAm-I
*    Bulk Upload Capability added
*    Import Plugin Support added
*    PDF Importer function added
*    Presenter Texture can be changed by simply replacing the sloodle_presenter_texture file in the contents of the Presenter
*    Fixed bug where if user deleted the sloodle_presenter_texture after the presenter was deeded to a group, the parcel media was set to a NULL value.
*    Owner can prevent others from controlling  the slide show

** Sloodle Set
*    Updated the design
*    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdXiKJeWXZg

** Picture Glossary
*    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRw4AYH9bNE
*    New tool which Displays Textures in Second Life
*    Simply create a glossary and copy add the following as the objects description: 
*    textureUUID:scaleX:scaleY:scultpUUID
*    Then students can search for the glossary term by typing /pix glossary name - texture then appears in Second Life custom scaled.

** Quiz Chair Updates
*    The last sloodle_mod_quiz-1.0.lsl (as in sloodle 0.4 revision 10 ) accepted four question types: Multiple Choice, True False, Numerical, and Short Answer question types.  The drawback is that all are presented as Multiple Choice and converted if necessary.  This conversion destroys the nature of the Numerical, and Short Answer question types, as the right answer may become the only option in the question. When teachers select a Numerical or Short Answer question type they want something really different than selecting multiple choice of 2, 3 ,4 ... options. This version keeps the nature of the question types. It listens numerical and short answers through local chat and multiple choice and true-false through the dialog menus. So they run mixed but without loosing their nature.

** Web Intercom
*    Now chats the location of the archived chat when the intercom is turned off.
*   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8giZ47hA_dg

** Error Messages
*    All error messages are now translated!

** Access Checker Door 
*    has been removed due to the fact that it does not actually block access to spaces in Second Life, but simply is a door which opens if the user is a member of the course

** Sloodle Awards System
*    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvLvq-DIbs4
*    Motivate your Students by awarding them points in Second Life, and have those points automatically fed into the gradebook and count towards their final grade on MOODLE!
*    Scavenger Hunt Plugin - Students get points for completing a scavenger hunt in Second Life!
*    Stipend Giver Plugin - Give stipends to your students for them to get started in the virtual world

9. INSTALLATION
===============================================================================

You can usually upgrade old versions simply by removing the existing
SLOODLE folder(s) from your installation, and replacing them with the
new ones.

There are four parts which you can install. The first is required in
order to use SLOODLE, but the other two are optional, and simply
provide some additional functionality.

-----------------
Module (required)
-----------------
1. Navigate to your Moodle's "mod" folder
2. If a "sloodle" folder exists there already, then delete it
3. Add the "sloodle" folder from this download


----------------
Block (optional)
----------------
1. Navigate to your Moodle's "blocks" folder
2. If a "sloodle_menu" fodler exists there already, then delete it
3. Add the "sloodle_menu" folder from this download


-------------------------------------------
Sloodle Object Assignment plugin (optional)
-------------------------------------------
(Enables use of the PrimDrop object)

1. Navigate to your Moodle's "mod/assignment/type" folder
2. If a "sloodleobject" folder exists there already, then delete it
3. Add the "sloodleobject" folder from this download


If you are using Moodle 1.8, or one of the older Moodle 1.9 installations, then
the SLOODLE Object assignment will be displayed in Moodle menus as
"[[typesloodleobject]]". If this happens, you will need to alter your primary
language pack. E.g. if your primary language is English, then the  is "en_utf8".

ONLY do this if your observe "[[typesloodleobject]]" in your Moodle site.

1. Navigate to your Moodle's "lang/" folder
2. Open the "assignment.php" file
3. Scroll to the bottom and add this line immediately before the last "?&gt;":
    $string['typesloodleobject'] = 'Sloodle Object';

You can change the 'Sloodle Object' text to suit your needs.
You can repeat the process for other languages if necessary.

10. SLOODLE ADDONS INSTALLATION
===============================================================================
There are several addons being released with Sloodle 1.0. Addons are sloodle tools which have not yet been integrated into the Sloodle Core release due to not enough user testing. However, the addons listed are fully functional and extend Sloodle's functionality! We encourage you to try out the Sloodle addons! NOTE: There may be extra installation needed to add these to your Sloodle Website.

Information about Sloodle Addons can be found here: http://slisweb.sjsu.edu/sl/index.php/Download_Sloodle
