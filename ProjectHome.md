SLOODLE (Simulation Linked Object Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment) is a project to integrate the VLE platform Moodle with the 3D world of Second Life. Imagine a Moodle course that, if you wanted, could turn into a proper 3D interactive classroom with all your Moodle resources available to your students in the virtual world.

SLOODLE has been used to support teaching and learning across the globe, and is growing rapidly.
