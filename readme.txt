Welcome to the SLOODLE OpenSim Launcher
=======================================
[Based on SLOODLE 1.0.1]


PLEASE NOTE!
This is a HIGHLY experimental proof-of-concept project.
It may not be developed any further by us, and we cannot provide support for it.
Please do NOT attempt to use it unless you are an experienced developer.


Compatibility
-------------
Requires:
- Windows server platform (with root access)
- Moodle 1.8 or 1.9
- Root access to MySQL database

Not compatible with any other SLOODLE release.



Purpose
-------
This version of SLOODLE lets you setup an exercise in OpenSim, and then have a separate instance created for each student on-demand. Note that an entire OpenSim standalone virtual world is created for each student, each time they do the exercise.

This is helpful if you have an individual exercise which you need to multiple students to carry out at the same time, each on their own.
