Hi there! This version of the quiz chair works with th SLOODLE AWARDS SYSTEM with the New Api - which can be found in the 1.0-with-lsl-api branch on googlecode - 
You can obtain that here: 
http://download.socialminds.jp/sloodle/latest/sloodle_all.zip


Using this quiz chair, students can now get points  listed on the scoreboard, and recorded on the MOODLE Website if they answer questions correctly.

To enable this functionality, you will have to generate two notecards
1) a notecard for the sloodle awards system which you will call "sloodle_award_config"
2) another notecard for the quiz chair which you will call sloodle_config

 Instructions are listed below:

 You can generate a sloodle_awards_config by:

1) Logging into your MOODLE/SLOODLE website as administrator
2) Go into your course
3) Click on your SLOODLE Controller
4) Click on the link called "Sloodle Awards System" and generate the notecard
5) Copy and paste the text generated into a notecard called sloodle_award_config
6)add a line to the sloodle_award_config to define how many points will be given per question:

eg.

points|100

7) Press save, and copy it into the quiz chair!
8) now create another notecard and call it sloodle_config and drop it into the quiz chair


NOTE: If you don't see the "Sloodle Awards System" in your list of options in the Controller page, either
a) you have either Sloodle 0.4, or 0.3 installed - you need Sloole 1.0-with-lsl-api branch
