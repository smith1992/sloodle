/**
*
* Script for exposing a distributor object to public web access.
* This is intended for use only on the servers of people who want to run a distributor for Sloodle objects.
*
* ( However, functionality that accesses it to send the avatar of their choice suitable objects 
* for their Sloodle install, once written, is intended to go into the regular Sloodle distribution. )
* 
* It should be installed under mod/sloodle, ie. in the same directory as sl_config.php
*
* Parts of this script require manual configuration. (See below)
*
* Distributor functionality is based on that used in view/distributor.php
* 
* WARNING: 
*   As of 2009-12-18, this script does not respect course permissions or distributor public / group settings.
*   Ideally, it should probably ignore course permissions but only run if the distributor is public.
*   Since it is anticipated that only a few people will want to run it on their servers, it should probably either:
*      a) Not be included in the standard Sloodle distribution, or
*      b) Included, but with an "exit" right at the start so that it only runs if manually altered.
*   For now, we'll check it into tools/distribution/, and install it manually where we need it.
*
* Usage examples: 
* 
* Send the object "thing" in the distributor with ID 14 to the user with the key 746ad236-d28d-4aab-93de-1e09a076c5f3
* http://dev1.socialminds.jp/mod/sloodle/public_distributor.php?id=14&object=thing&user=746ad236-d28d-4aab-93de-1e09a076c5f3
*
* Send the object "thing" in the distributor with ID 14 to the user with the name Edmund Earp
* http://dev1.socialminds.jp/mod/sloodle/public_distributor.php?id=14&object=thing&av_name=Edmund%20Earp
