<h4>Object Authorization</h4>
<p>
 You can authorize individual objects to allow them to interact with the Moodle site.
 This is more secure than using a Prim Password, but also more complicated and time-consuming.

<p>
 When asked if you want to authorize an object, click 'Yes' to allow the object to interact with
 the Moodle site, or 'No' to ignore it.
