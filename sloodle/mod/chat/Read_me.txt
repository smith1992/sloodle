There are 2 linking files - but you only need to use one.

sl_chat_linker.php - the "Chat bot" account must be logged into the Moodle chat room - this is to stop unwanted spam.

sl_chat_linker_noauth.php - the Chat bot doesn’t have o be logged into Moodle - this is less secure but is useful for permanent "chat rooms" in Second life.
