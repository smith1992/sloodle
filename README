===============================================================================
1. WHAT IS SLOODLE?
===============================================================================
SLOODLE is an Open Source project which integrates the multi-user virtual environment of Second Life® with the Moodle® learning-management system funded by the Eduserve Foundation in the UK (http://www.eduserv.org.uk/)

SLOODLE provides a range of tools for supporting learning and teaching to the immersive virtual world; tools which are integrated with a tried and tested leading web-based learning management system. 
Sloodle is a platform to connect a Moodle Learning management website with the Virtual world of Second Life.

Sloodle consists of two parts: A zip file which gets unzipped and installed on your MOODLE Learning Management Website, and 
a suite of tools which can be rezzed (brought out of your inventory) into Second Life.

SLOODLE is free for use under the GNU GPL license - http://www.gnu.org/licenses/ and is funded and supported by Eduserv – http://www.eduserv.ac.uk/ with network services provided by San Jose State University's School of Library and Information Science - http://slisweb.sjsu.edu.

Dr. Daniel Livingstone, University of the West of Scotland, UK is co-founder and Eduserv principle investigator. Jeremy Kemp with SJSU is co-founder.


===============================================================================
2. RELEASE NOTES
===============================================================================
SLOODLE 1.1 comes with some optimisations, and the addition of simple backup/restore functionality.
If you backup a course with SLOODLE modules in it, then they will be stored in your backup too.
Currently, avatars are not backed-up, and your Presenter will remember the URLs of slides -- it won't actually backup the slides themselves.

Please note that all SLOODLE 1.0 tools should work with SLOODLE 1.1.


===============================================================================
3. INSTALLATION
===============================================================================

You can usually upgrade old versions simply by removing the existing
SLOODLE folder(s) from your installation, and replacing them with the
new ones.

There are four parts which you can install. The first is required in
order to use SLOODLE, but the other two are optional, and simply
provide some additional functionality.

-----------------
Module (required)
-----------------
1. Navigate to your Moodle's "mod" folder
2. If a "sloodle" folder exists there already, then delete it
3. Add the "sloodle" folder from this download


----------------
Block (optional)
----------------
1. Navigate to your Moodle's "blocks" folder
2. If a "sloodle_menu" fodler exists there already, then delete it
3. Add the "sloodle_menu" folder from this download


-------------------------------------------
Sloodle Object Assignment plugin (optional)
-------------------------------------------
(Enables use of the PrimDrop object)

1. Navigate to your Moodle's "mod/assignment/type" folder
2. If a "sloodleobject" folder exists there already, then delete it
3. Add the "sloodleobject" folder from this download


If you are using Moodle 1.8, or one of the older Moodle 1.9 installations, then
the SLOODLE Object assignment will be displayed in Moodle menus as
"[[typesloodleobject]]". If this happens, you will need to alter your primary
language pack. E.g. if your primary language is English, then the  is "en_utf8".

ONLY do this if your observe "[[typesloodleobject]]" in your Moodle site.

1. Navigate to your Moodle's "lang/" folder
2. Open the "assignment.php" file
3. Scroll to the bottom and add this line immediately before the last "?&gt;":
    $string['typesloodleobject'] = 'Sloodle Object';

You can change the 'Sloodle Object' text to suit your needs.
You can repeat the process for other languages if necessary.
