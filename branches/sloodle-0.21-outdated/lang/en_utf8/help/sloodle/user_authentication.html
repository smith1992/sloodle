<h4>User Authentication</h4>
<p>
 This setting determines what should happen when an unknown in-world user tries to use a Sloodle object.
</p>
<h5>Web mode</h5>
<p>
 In this mode, the in-world user is instructed to visit a web-page on your Moodle site, where
 they can login to link their in-world avatar with their Moodle account. This mode is recommended
 for most purposes.
</p>
<h5>Auto mode</h5>
<p>
 In this mode, Sloodle attempts to automatically create a new account on the Moodle site, with the
 same name as the user encountered in-world (note that, if a user of the same name already exists,
 then Sloodle will try to find an alternative username). This mode is recommended if you only students
 to use Sloodle in-world, and do not expect any interaction with Moodle through a web-browser.
