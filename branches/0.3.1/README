SLOODLE 0.3.1
=============

Project homepage: http://www.sloodle.org

Thanks for downloading SLOODLE 0.3.1!

This is a minor release which builds on SLOODLE 0.3, first released in August 2008.
It should be stable and feature-complete on Moodle 1.8 and 1.9.
Parts of it may work on other versions of Moodle, but it has not been fully tested.

Please refer to our website and our documentation wiki for
further information, and you can also visit us in-world,
at the "Sloodle" island.


If you encounter any problems, you are welcome to get in touch
with us on our forums, or by IM-ing one of the development team
in-world. If you have encountered a bug, you can also report it
directly on our GoogleCode issues tracker:

============
INSTALLATION
============

There are three parts which you can install. The first is required in
order to use SLOODLE, but the other two are optional, and simply
provide some additional functionality.

-----------------
Module (required)
-----------------
1. Navigate to your Moodle's "mod" folder
2. If a "sloodle" folder exists there already, then delete it
3. Add the "sloodle" folder from this download


----------------
Block (optional)
----------------
1. Navigate to your Moodle's "blocks" folder
2. If a "sloodle_menu" fodler exists there already, then delete it
3. Add the "sloodle_menu" folder from this download


-------------------------------------------
SLOODLE Object Assignment plugin (optional)
-------------------------------------------
(Enables use of the PrimDrop object)

1. Navigate to your Moodle's "mod/assignment/type" folder
2. If a "sloodleobject" folder exists there already, then delete it
3. Add the "sloodleobject" folder from this download

You will also need to alter your primary language pack.
E.g. if your primary language is English, then the <langcode> is "en_utf8".

1. Navigate to your Moodle's "lang/<langcode>" folder
2. Open the "assignment.php" file
3. Scroll to the bottom and add this line immediately before the last "?>":
    $string['typesloodleobject'] = 'SLOODLE Object';

You can change the 'SLOODLE Object' text to suit your needs.
You can repeat the process for other languages if necessary.
