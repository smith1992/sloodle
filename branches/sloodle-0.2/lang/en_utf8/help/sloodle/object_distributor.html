<h4>Object Distributor</h4>
<p>
 The Sloodle Object Distibutor is used to distribute in-world objects to in-world avatars,
 using a web-based interface.
</p>
<p>
 Anybody can use it, allowing users to retrieve the latest objects for themselves.
 This can be used to allow automatic in-world distribution of specially customized
 objects, such as the Sloodle Toolbar.
