<h4>Object Authorization</h4>
<p>
 For extra security, objects can be individually authorized to access your Moodle site.
 Each one is given its own password, and can only access the course you enable it to access.
 This is more secure than the old 'Prim Password'.
</p>
<p>
 Each object is linked to a particular "Sloodle Controller". You can see a list of all objects
 authorized for a particular Controller by clicking on the Controller link on your course.
