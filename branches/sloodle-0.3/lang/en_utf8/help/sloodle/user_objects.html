<h4>User Objects</h4>
<p>
 Certain objects, such as the Sloodle Toolbar, are 'user-centric'. This means that instead of educators
 authorizing them to access courses, individual users (including students) can authorize them for their
 own use, such as writing to their own Moodle blog.

 You can see a list of all the objects authorized by a particular user by visiting that user's Sloodle Profile
 page (which also lists their avatar).
