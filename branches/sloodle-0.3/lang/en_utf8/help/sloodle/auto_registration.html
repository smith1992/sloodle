<h4>User Auto Registration</h4>
<p>
 Auto registration allows avatars to have a new Moodle account automatically registered for them
 by Sloodle. This saves time, and prevents the need for SL users to interact directly with Moodle at all.
 It must first be enabled at the site-level by an administrator, and it must then be enabled for each
 course as well.
</p>
<h5>Warning!</h5>
<p>
 Auto-registration is not compatible with any registration/enrolment plugins.
 Admins should only enable for your site if you do not rely on any external login system.
 Educators should only enable it for your course if you do not have any special enrolment requirements,
  such as an enrolment key or payment, as these will all be by-passed.
